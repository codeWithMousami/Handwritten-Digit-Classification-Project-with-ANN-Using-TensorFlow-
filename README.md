# Handwritten-Digit-Classification-Project-with-ANN-Using-TensorFlow-

I'm thrilled to share the success of my recent project on Handwritten Digit Classification using Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Leveraging the powerful TensorFlow framework, I delved into the popular MNIST dataset, which contains rough images of digits ranging from 0 to 9.

In the initial phase, I trained the ANN with a single hidden layer, achieving an impressive accuracy of 97% with just 10 epochs (iterations). However, my pursuit of excellence led me to explore further improvements.

Recognizing the potential for enhanced accuracy, I introduced an additional hidden layer and extended the training epochs to 25. The results were promising! The accuracy experienced a slight but crucial increase, reaching new heights in precision.

Upon analyzing the real versus predicted images, the refined model demonstrated a remarkable 98% accuracy. This significant improvement underscores the impact of iterative optimization and fine-tuning in achieving superior results.

Technical Details:

Framework: TensorFlow
Dataset: MNIST (Handwritten Digits)
Architecture: Two Hidden Layers in ANN
Epochs: 25 for Optimal Results


Continuous Improvement:
But the journey doesn't end here! I'm committed to continuous refinement and exploring avenues for further optimization. Your insights and feedback are invaluable as I continue to push the boundaries of accuracy and performance in machine learning.
